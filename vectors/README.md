Has no real order for now but if someone has experience in this please redo this.



## Layers:

1. ### Chunks
Are Only here to help you while editing the map, to divide work in your brain.

2. ### Original
The original map for overlay purposes, to trace everything

3. ### Chunk Data
- Bridges
- Buildings
- Roads

The main/important data is here roads, buildings, bridges
Export these in own layers to categorize them later in the geoJSON

4. ### Polygons
This is the underlying data for geography types (water, sand, grass, forest)

 4.1. **Water**
- Openwater
- Lakes
- Rivers

The water data, for now we only have 3 different water types

4.2. **Sand**
n/a

4.3. **Greens**
n/a

4.4. **BG**

This is probably not needed for export, just to make it nicer
